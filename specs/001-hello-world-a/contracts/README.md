# Contracts Directory

This directory typically contains API contracts, schemas, and interface definitions.

For the Hello World feature (Story #1), there are no API contracts as this is a simple CLI that displays a message with no external interfaces.

Future stories will populate this directory with:
- LLM API request/response schemas (Story #3)
- Configuration file schemas (Story #2+)
- Git command interfaces
- ADR file format specifications

**Status**: N/A for this feature
