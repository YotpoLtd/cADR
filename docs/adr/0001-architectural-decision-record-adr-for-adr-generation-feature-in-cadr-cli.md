# Architectural Decision Record (ADR) for ADR Generation Feature in cadr-cli

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The `cadr-cli` tool is designed to assist developers and architects in generating Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT. This feature aims to automate the creation of ADRs based on the code changes within a repository, thereby streamlining the documentation process of architectural decisions. The necessity for this feature arises from the need to maintain a consistent and structured approach to documenting architectural decisions, which is crucial for the long-term maintenance and understanding of software projects.

## Decision Drivers

- **Automation of Documentation**: Reducing the manual effort required to document architectural decisions.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring that ADRs follow a consistent format and structure, making them easier to read and understand.
- **Integration with Development Workflow**: Seamlessly integrating the generation of ADRs into the development workflow without disrupting existing processes.
- **Quality and Completeness**: Improving the quality and completeness of ADRs by providing a structured template and prompts for information that should be included.

## Considered Options

1. **Manual Creation**: Continue with the manual creation of ADRs without any automation.
2. **Template Generation**: Provide a static template for ADRs that developers can fill out manually.
3. **LLM-based Generation**: Implement an LLM-based feature that automatically generates ADR content based on code changes and prompts.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **"LLM-based Generation"**, because it provides the best balance between automation and quality of documentation. This option allows for the automatic generation of ADRs that are consistent and structured, while still requiring minimal manual effort from developers. The LLM-based approach can analyze code changes and generate comprehensive ADR drafts that developers can then review and refine, ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the architectural decisions made.

### Positive Consequences

- **Increased Efficiency**: Developers save time by automating the initial draft creation of ADRs.
- **Improved Consistency**: ADRs generated by the tool follow a consistent format, improving readability and understanding across the team.
- **Enhanced Documentation Quality**: Leveraging LLMs to generate ADR content can lead to more detailed and comprehensive documentation.
- **Seamless Integration**: The feature is integrated into the `cadr-cli` tool, making it easy for developers to adopt without
