# Feature Specification: LLM-Powered Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `003-llm-powered-analysis`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As Alex the developer, I want cadr to send my staged code changes to an LLM for analysis, so that the tool can intelligently decide if the changes are architecturally significant. The tool should use OpenAI as the LLM provider, support a --analyze flag to trigger analysis, create cadr.yaml config via cadr init command, send file paths and git diff content to the LLM, use OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable for authentication, and follow fail-open principle (always exit 0, just display result)."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Description: "LLM-Powered Analysis for architectural significance detection"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developer using cadr CLI

   ‚Üí Data: Staged file paths, git diff content, LLM analysis results
   ‚Üí Constraints: OpenAI provider, --analyze flag, cadr.yaml config, fail-open principle
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No critical ambiguities for this well-defined feature
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow defined below
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All requirements testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Configuration and analysis entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details included
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Focus on user value (intelligent architectural analysis)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

**As Alex the developer**, I want `cadr` to send my staged code changes to an LLM for **analysis**, so that the tool can intelligently decide if the changes are architecturally significant.

This feature enables intelligent analysis of code changes to help developers identify when their modifications might warrant creating an Architectural Decision Record (ADR).

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has staged files in a Git repository, **When** they run `cadr --analyze`, **Then** the tool sends the staged changes to the LLM and displays whether the changes are architecturally significant

2. **Given** a developer has no `cadr.yaml` configuration file, **When** they run `cadr init`, **Then** the tool creates a configuration file with interactive prompts for LLM provider settings

3. **Given** a developer has configured OpenAI settings, **When** they run `cadr --analyze`, **Then** the tool uses the configured settings to analyze their staged changes

4. **Given** the LLM analysis determines changes are significant, **When** the tool completes analysis, **Then** it displays the significance result and reasoning to the developer

5. **Given** the LLM analysis determines changes are not significant, **When** the tool completes analysis, **Then** it displays the non-significance result and reasoning to the developer

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when the LLM API call fails?**
  ‚Üí The tool logs a warning message and exits with code 0 (fail-open principle)

- **What happens when the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing?**
  ‚Üí The tool displays a helpful error message and exits with code 0

- **What happens when there are no staged files to analyze?**
  ‚Üí The tool displays a message indicating no changes to analyze and exits with code 0

- **What happens when the LLM API is rate limited?**
  ‚Üí The tool displays a rate limit error message and exits with code 0 (no retries)

- **What happens when the cadr.yaml configuration is invalid?**
  ‚Üí The tool displays a configuration error message and exits with code 0

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a `cadr init` command that interactively creates a `cadr.yaml` configuration file

- **FR-002**: The system MUST support a `--analyze` flag that triggers LLM analysis of staged Git changes

- **FR-003**: The system MUST send staged file paths and git diff content to the configured LLM provider for analysis

- **FR-004**: The system MUST parse LLM responses in the format `{"is_significant": boolean, "reason": string}`

- **FR-005**: The system MUST display analysis results (significance and reasoning) to the developer

- **FR-006**: The system MUST use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable for OpenAI authentication

- **FR-007**: The system MUST follow the fail-open principle: always exit with code 0, even on errors

- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide helpful error messages when LLM calls fail, API keys are missing, or configuration is invalid

- **FR-009**: The system MUST handle rate limiting by displaying an error message without retries

- **FR-010**: The system MUST validate `cadr.yaml` configuration on load and provide clear error messages for invalid settings

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Configuration**: Represents the `cadr.yaml` file containing LLM provider settings, model preferences, and analysis parameters

- **Analysis Request**: Represents the data sent to the LLM including staged file paths, git diff content, and analysis context

- **Analysis Result**: Represents the LLM response containing significance determination and reasoning explanation

## Notes for Next Phase (Planning)

When moving to the planning phase, consider:

1. **Configuration Management**: How to implement `cadr init` with interactive prompts for YAML generation
2. **LLM Integration**: How to integrate OpenAI SDK for analysis requests and response parsing
3. **Git Integration**: How to extract staged file paths and git diff content for LLM analysis
4. **Error Handling**: How to implement fail-open principle with helpful error messages
5. **Testing Strategy**: How to mock OpenAI API calls and test various analysis scenarios

This spec establishes the foundation for intelligent architectural analysis that future features will build upon.
