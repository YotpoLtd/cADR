**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Hello World - A deployable NPM package that displays a welcome message when running npx cadr"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Description: "Deployable NPM package with welcome message"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developer installing/using the package
   ‚Üí Actions: Install via NPM, execute via npx

   ‚Üí Constraints: Must be publicly installable, must work via npx
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No critical ambiguities for this simple feature
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow defined below
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All requirements testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è  No data entities for this feature (removed section)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details included
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Focus on user value (verify CI/CD and public installation)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a developer**, I want to install `cadr-cli` via NPM and run its command to see a "Hello, cADR!" message, **so that we can verify the CI/CD release pipeline and public installation process works correctly.**

This is a foundational story that validates our ability to:
- Package and publish the tool to NPM
- Make it executable via `npx`
- Ensure the release automation works end-to-end
- Provide a simple smoke test for initial adoption

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has Node.js installed on their machine, **When** they run `npx cadr@0.0.1` without prior installation, **Then** the package downloads automatically and displays "Hello, cADR!" or similar welcome message

2. **Given** a developer has globally installed `cadr-cli` via `npm install -g cadr-cli@0.0.1`, **When** they run `cadr` in their terminal, **Then** the welcome message is displayed immediately

3. **Given** the package is published to the NPM registry, **When** a developer searches for "cadr" on npmjs.com, **Then** the `cadr-cli` package appears with version 0.0.1 and basic metadata (description, repository link)

4. **Given** the release workflow runs successfully, **When** a version tag (e.g., `v0.0.1`) is pushed to the repository, **Then** the package is automatically published to NPM without manual intervention

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when the user runs the command with no internet connection after initial install?**
  ‚Üí The welcome message should still display (no network calls required for this feature)

- **What happens when the user runs the command with unsupported Node.js version?**
  ‚Üí The package should display a clear error message indicating minimum Node.js version requirement

- **What happens when the NPM registry is temporarily unavailable during `npx` execution?**
  ‚Üí If the package is cached, it runs. If not cached, `npx` shows its standard error (not controlled by our package)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The package MUST be installable from the public NPM registry using `npm install cadr-cli@0.0.1` or `npx cadr@0.0.1`

- **FR-002**: The package MUST provide an executable command named `cadr` that can be invoked from the terminal

- **FR-003**: When executed without arguments, the `cadr` command MUST display a welcome message that includes:
  - Product name ("cADR" or "Hello, cADR!")
  - Brief one-line description of what the tool does
  - Version number (0.0.1)

- **FR-004**: The welcome message MUST be visible in the terminal within 2 seconds of command invocation on standard developer hardware

- **FR-005**: The release pipeline MUST automatically publish the package to NPM when a git tag matching pattern `v*.*.*` is pushed to the repository

- **FR-006**: The published package MUST include essential metadata:
  - Package name: `cadr-cli`
  - Version: `0.0.1`
  - Description clearly explaining it's an ADR automation tool
  - Repository URL linking to the source code
  - Public access (not scoped/private)

- **FR-007**: The package MUST work on any platform that supports Node.js 20+ (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- **FR-008**: The command MUST exit with status code 0 upon successful display of the welcome message

### Success Criteria

This feature is successful when:
1. ‚úÖ A developer can run `npx cadr@0.0.1` and see the welcome message
2. ‚úÖ The package appears on npmjs.com with correct metadata
3. ‚úÖ The GitHub release workflow completes without errors
4. ‚úÖ The code passes peer review with all DoD criteria met

## Notes for Next Phase (Planning)

When moving to the planning phase, consider:

1. **Testing Strategy**: How to test NPM publication in CI without actually publishing (test registry? dry-run mode?)
2. **Versioning**: Confirm version numbering strategy (0.0.1 for this initial release)
3. **Message Content**: Draft the exact welcome message text (keep it friendly and informative)
4. **Package Naming**: Confirm `cadr-cli` is available on NPM registry
5. **Documentation**: Ensure README has installation instructions before first release

This spec is intentionally minimal - the goal is pipeline validation, not feature completeness.
