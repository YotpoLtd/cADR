# Feature Specification: ADR Generation

**Feature Branch**: `004-adr-generation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "As Alex the developer, after detecting an architecturally significant change, I want cadr to prompt me to generate an ADR, and upon confirmation, automatically create a draft ADR file following the MADR template format. The system should use the same LLM model for generation, create the docs/adr/ directory if it doesn't exist, auto-generate the ADR title and filename based on the change context, prompt for user confirmation (ENTER/yes), and manually create the ADR file without requiring external tools like adr-tools."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Description: "Automated ADR file generation for architecturally significant changes"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developer using cadr CLI after analysis phase
   ‚Üí Actions: Prompt user, generate ADR content, create markdown file
   ‚Üí Data: LLM-generated ADR content, file paths, ADR metadata
   ‚Üí Constraints: MADR format, same model as analysis, user confirmation required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No critical ambiguities for this well-defined feature
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow defined below
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All requirements testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ ADR content, file management, prompt entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details included
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Focus on user value (automated documentation creation)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

**As Alex the developer**, after detecting an architecturally significant change, I want `cadr` to **automatically generate a draft ADR file**, so that architectural decisions are documented at the moment they're made without manual effort.

This feature enables automatic creation of well-structured ADR documentation, reducing friction in the documentation process and ensuring decisions are captured immediately.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** cadr has detected an architecturally significant change, **When** the analysis completes, **Then** the system prompts the user to generate an ADR with clear options to confirm or skip

2. **Given** a user confirms ADR generation (presses ENTER or types "yes"), **When** the generation process starts, **Then** the system calls the LLM to generate ADR content following the MADR template

3. **Given** the LLM has generated ADR content, **When** the content is received, **Then** the system automatically creates the `docs/adr/` directory if it doesn't exist

4. **Given** ADR content is ready to save, **When** determining the filename, **Then** the system automatically generates a numbered filename (e.g., 0001-title-slug.md) based on existing ADRs

5. **Given** the ADR file is created successfully, **When** the process completes, **Then** the system displays the file path and next steps to the user

6. **Given** a user declines ADR generation (types "no"), **When** the prompt is answered, **Then** the system skips generation and displays a reminder message

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when the LLM generation call fails?**
  ‚Üí The system logs an error, displays a helpful message, and exits gracefully (fail-open principle)

- **What happens when the docs/adr/ directory cannot be created?**
  ‚Üí The system displays an error with the specific permission or filesystem issue

- **What happens when an ADR file with the same name already exists?**
  ‚Üí The system increments the number and uses the next available number

- **What happens when the LLM generates invalid or incomplete content?**
  ‚Üí The system detects missing sections and either retries or saves what's available with a warning

- **What happens when the diff is too large for the LLM context?**
  ‚Üí The system displays a clear error message suggesting to stage fewer files

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST prompt the user for ADR generation after detecting an architecturally significant change, with options to confirm (ENTER/yes) or decline (no)

- **FR-002**: The system MUST use the same LLM model configured for analysis to generate ADR content

- **FR-003**: The system MUST generate ADR content following the MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) template format

- **FR-004**: The system MUST include the following MADR sections: Title, Status, Date, Context and Problem Statement, Decision Drivers, Considered Options, Decision Outcome, Consequences, More Information

- **FR-005**: The system MUST automatically create the `docs/adr/` directory if it does not exist

- **FR-006**: The system MUST scan existing ADR files to determine the next sequential number (0001, 0002, etc.)

- **FR-007**: The system MUST auto-generate a filename-safe slug from the ADR title for the filename (e.g., "Use PostgreSQL" ‚Üí "use-postgresql")

- **FR-008**: The system MUST create ADR files with the format: `NNNN-title-slug.md` where NNNN is a zero-padded 4-digit number

- **FR-009**: The system MUST display a success message with the file path after creating the ADR

- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide guidance on next steps (review, refine, commit) after ADR creation

- **FR-011**: The system MUST follow the fail-open principle: if generation fails, log the error and exit gracefully without blocking the user

- **FR-012**: The system MUST handle user cancellation gracefully and display a reminder to document the decision manually

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Generation Prompt**: The versioned LLM prompt template (v1) that instructs the model to create MADR-formatted content

- **Generation Request**: Data structure containing file paths, diff content, and the reasoning from analysis

- **Generation Result**: The LLM response containing the complete ADR markdown content and extracted title

- **ADR File**: The markdown file stored in `docs/adr/` with a numbered filename following MADR structure

- **User Prompt**: Interactive CLI prompt asking for confirmation to generate the ADR

## Notes for Next Phase (Planning)

When moving to the planning phase, consider:

1. **Generation Prompt Design**: How to create a versioned prompt that produces consistent MADR-formatted output
2. **File Management**: How to implement directory creation, file numbering, and slug generation
3. **User Interaction**: How to implement the confirmation prompt with industry-standard CLI patterns
4. **LLM Integration**: How to extend existing LLM module for generation requests
5. **Error Handling**: How to maintain fail-open principle throughout the generation flow
6. **Testing Strategy**: How to mock LLM responses and test file creation scenarios

This spec establishes the foundation for seamless ADR documentation that completes the core value proposition of cADR.
